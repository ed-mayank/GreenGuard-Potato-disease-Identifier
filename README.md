I spearheaded a transformative project at the intersection of machine learning and web development, utilizing a cutting-edge tech stack. Employing TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), I engineered a sophisticated model for the accurate classification of potato leaves into categories such as Early Blight disease, Late Blight disease, or a healthy state. The robust backend infrastructure was constructed using FastAPI, ensuring high-performance API endpoints and facilitating seamless communication with the frontend.
